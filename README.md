## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- React Native CLI (via [@react-native-community/cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli))
- Xcode (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development)
- [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) (for iOS projects)

### Step 1: Start Metro

Metro is the JavaScript bundler for React Native. Open a terminal in the root of your project and run:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start

Step 2: Build and Run Your App
With Metro running, open a new terminal at the root of your project and execute the following commands for your target platform:
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
If everything is set up correctly, your app will launch in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or on your connected device. You can also build your app directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

Step 3: Modify Your App
After successfully running the app, it's time to start coding!

Open App.tsx (or the relevant entry file) in your text editor.
Make your desired changes.
Save the file – Fast Refresh will automatically update your running app.
If you need to force a full reload (for instance, to reset the state):

Android:
Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or open the Dev Menu (using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) and select Reload.
iOS:
Press <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.
