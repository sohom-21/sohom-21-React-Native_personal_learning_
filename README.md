# My React Native Projects
---
Welcome to my collection of React Native projects! This repository houses several starter apps and utilities designed to help you get started with React Native development. Each project was bootstrapped using [@react-native-community/cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) and follows industry best practices.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you've completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- React Native CLI (via [@react-native-community/cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli))
- Xcode (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development)
- [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) (for iOS projects)

### Step 1: Start Metro

Metro is the JavaScript bundler for React Native. Open a terminal in the root of your project and run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Build and Run Your App

With Metro running, open a new terminal at the project root and execute the following commands based on your target platform:

#### Android

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

Your app should launch in the Android Emulator or on your connected device. You can also build the project directly from Android Studio.

#### iOS

If you're developing for iOS, run your app via Xcode or the following command if set up:

```bash
# Using npm (if configured)
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn (if configured)
yarn ios
```

### Step 3: Modify Your App

Once your app is running, start coding:

1. **Open** the main entry file (usually `App.tsx`) in your favorite editor.
2. **Make changes** to the code.
3. **Save** your file – **Fast Refresh** will automatically update your running app.

> **Tip:** To force a full reload:
>
> - **Android:** Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or open the Dev Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) and select *Reload*.
> - **iOS:** Press <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.
